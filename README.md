## The components of our analysis and their function:

## D3.js: 

A javascript based visualization engine which will render interactive charts and graphs based on the data.
## Dc.js: 

A javascript based wrapper library for D3.js which makes plotting the charts a lot easier.
## Crossfilter.js: 

A javascript based data manipulation library. Works splendid with dc.js. Enables two way data binding.

Our powerful server which serves data to the visualization engine and also hosts the webpages and javascript libraries.

## Mongo DB: 

The resident No-SQL database which will serve as a fantastic data repository for our project.
